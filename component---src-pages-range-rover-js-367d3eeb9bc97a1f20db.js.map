Frequently imitated, but\n          rarely bettered or even equalled, the Range Rover has been around\n          since the early Seventies. And even though that means it’s only a\n          couple years shy of its fiftieth birthday, the Rangie is still only in\n          its fourth generation. Admittedly the fact the first-gen (later known\n          as the ‘Classic’) lasted for more than two decades skews that figure a\n          bit. But still…\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          The current car was launched in 2012. It debuted a new aluminium\n          monocoque that cost the company a billion quid or so to develop. So\n          even though it’s bigger than the car it replaced, it’s lighter by in\n          some cases almost half a tonne. That means it’s faster, tangibly\n          better to drive and more efficient. And with the 2018 facelift comes\n          even more efficiency, thanks to the introduction of the P400e plug-in\n          hybrid, which pairs a 296bhp, four-cylinder petrol engine with a\n          114bhp electric motor for 64g/km of CO2, a claimed 101mpg and 31 miles\n          of all-electric range. The P400e replaces the SDV6 Hybrid (a\n          conventional, non-plug-in hybrid with the 3.0-litre V6 diesel and a\n          small electric motor) in the line-up, but V6s and V8s in petrol and\n          diesel (with up to 557bhp for the flagship, 5.0-litre supercharged V8\n          petrol) remain available. All are linked to an eight-speed automatic\n          gearbox and all-wheel drive with the deeply clever ‘Terrain Response’\n          technology that gives the Rangie its peerless off-road ability.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Long- and short-wheelbase options are available, with prices starting\n          at £79,595 for the former and £112,900 for the latter, and rising to\n          £177,030 for V8-engined examples of Rangies fettled by JLR’s Special\n          Vehicle Operations division.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/05-d297418092985d3602dce421a3e32606.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
