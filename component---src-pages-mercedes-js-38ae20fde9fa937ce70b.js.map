Chief among them new\n          engines, Merc’s latest-generation in-line six-cylinder diesels and\n          petrols, plus a plug-in hybrid and the S63 AMG’s V8 bi-turbo petrol.\n          The rare-groove S65 is no more, but you can still get a V12-engined\n          S-Class in the form of the super-luxe, super-rare and super-expensive\n          £180,000 Mercedes-Maybach S650.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          This update also gave the S-Class an array of semi-autonomous driving\n          technology like Active Speed Limit Assist, Active Lane Change Assist\n          and Remote Parking Assist, most of which debuted in the E-Class. But\n          to make sure the S-Class kept its crown as the techiest Merc, it got a\n          few of its own too. The main one is a kind of active cruise control\n          that, as well as sensing and maintaining gaps to other cars, knows to\n          slow you for roundabouts, corners and tolls using GPS. Of course that\n          particular system has been rolled out to other Mercs now, but it’s\n          reasonable to expect much cleverness from the new S-Class, which could\n          be revealed as soon as this year.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Because this particular era of S-Class is so near the end of its life,\n          Mercedes has massively cut back on the number of trim levels/equipment\n          combinations if offers. Now there’s just one trim for the non-AMGs –\n          ‘Grand Edition’ – and only the cheapest S350d is available with the\n          short-wheelbase.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </Layout>\n);\n\nexport default IndexPage;\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/04-bb7f4b1cf37eab3abe1bdcfb71005a9b.jpg\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
